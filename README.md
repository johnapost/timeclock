Introduction
============

This is a sample timeclock application showing how I like to develop my applications. This also shows my gem preferences. I thought I would challenge myself with this one and use a minimum amount of pages, relying on AJAX to do all the heavy lifting.

Getting Started
===============

Dependencies
------------

* TimeClock uses the [Mysql2 gem](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2). Please refer to the gem's documentation to ensure that it is able to locate MySQL on your machine.

* TimeClock uses the [Poltergeist gem](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) for Capybara's JS driver. This gem requires PhantomJS version 1.8.1 or later. Refer to the documentation for installation if necessary.

* If there's anything I missed that you had trouble installing, please let me know. Thanks!

Initial Setup
--------------

With MySQL up and running on your machine all you should need to do is run `rake db:create db:seed db:migrate`.

Once that is set, you can log in with the below credentials:

* Email: admin@email.com
* Password: defaultpass

After you are logged in, you can create employee users as well as other administrators with the application interface.

Using the Application
=====================

This application is heavily reliant on JavaScript. Please make sure you have it enabled!

Testing
=======

Testing is handled with both RSpec and Cucumber. Please run `rspec` and `cucumber` to see the results.

Testing inconsistencies may be caused [by the Rails Spring preloader](https://github.com/rails/spring). Try running `spring stop` before running the tests to close any preloaded processes.
